I am a researcher in a data science, collaborating with companies and government to address research problems related to spatiotemporal data. My research involves analyzing mobile signaling records, hotel check-in registers, train and airline ticket data, and high-speed rail data, using time series and machine learning models, as well as deep learning models.
<!-- As a researcher in the field of data-driven analysis, I engage in collaborative efforts with industry and government partners to address complex research challenges. My work centers primarily on spatiotemporal data and the corresponding analytical methods used to interpret it. I employ a variety of data sources in my research, including mobile signaling records, hotel check-in registers, train ticket data, airline ticket data, and high-speed rail data, among others. My approach to analysis involves utilizing time series models, machine learning models, and sophisticated deep learning models such as spatiotemporal neural networks. Through the application of these cutting-edge techniques, my research seeks to advance our understanding of the complexities of spatiotemporal data and provide valuable insights for industry and government decision-makers.As a researcher in the field of data-driven analysis, I engage in collaborative efforts with industry and government partners to address complex research challenges.
